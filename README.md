# Final-Interactive-Project

My final project is an interactive showcase exploring encryptiuon in relation to human memory (with an anecdotal twist).

I initally had quite a large idea wherein there would be a multi-room artwork with interactions that'd serve as puzzles that forced the user to particpate in puzles that held semebe;ance to 'decryptiong' codes to achieve the finished password. This plan had involved three fully simulated encryption systems with much more complex animations and references to quantum computing, however the outrach of this could soon become very vague and a large project to handle alone and thus I chose o focus on an emotional narration that lends to encryption's effects. Addtionally, this idea's complexity was somehting that vould easily lose focus so I chose to focus on clarity and user interaction for cohesion.
