# Final-Interactive-Project


My final project is an interactive showcase exploring encryption in relation to human memory (with an anecdotal twist).

I initially had quite a large idea wherein there would be a multi-room artwork with interactions that served as puzzles, forcing the user to participate in tasks that held resemblance to ‘decrypting’ codes to achieve the final password. This plan had involved three fully simulated encryption systems with much more complex animations and references to quantum computing; however, the outreach of this could soon become very vague and a large project to handle alone, and thus I chose to focus on an emotional narration that lends itself to encryption’s effects. Additionally, this idea’s complexity was something that could easily lose focus, so I chose to prioritise clarity and user interaction for cohesion.

I have always had a fascination with encrypting information, and would often quite rashly lock things away as a child, leading to large amounts of my old work being essentially lost as I could no longer recall the passwords I’d set for these files. Similarly, I was quite interested in ransomware and the encryption it imposed on victims’ files — another way in which the effects of encryption would evoke memory.

To simulate the emotions rather than the technicalities of encryption, I designed a simplistic and supposedly harmless display of three computers from different points of my lifetime.
