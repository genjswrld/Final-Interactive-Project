# Final-Interactive-Project

https://genjswrld.github.io/Final-Interactive-Project/

My final project is an interactive showcase exploring encryption (with an anecdotal twist).

I initially had quite a large idea wherein there would be a multi-room artwork with interactions that served as puzzles, forcing the user to participate in tasks that held resemblance to ‘decrypting’ codes to achieve the final password. This plan had involved three fully simulated encryption systems with much more complex animations and references to quantum computing; however, the outreach of this could soon become very vague and a large project to handle alone, and thus I chose to focus on an emotional narration that lends itself to encryption’s effects. But as I developed it, I realised something, the emotional experience of encryption, the way it hides things, the way it loses things , felt more important than the technical process itself.

More importantly, I recognised that what actually interested me wasn’t encryption in a purely computational sense, but the emotional parallels: the way humans “scramble” or lock away feelings, memories, or events that they no longer want to confront.

So I scaled the project down into something more intimate, and more narratively focused.

To simulate the emotions rather than the technicalities of encryption, I designed a simplistic and supposedly harmless display of a desktop with purposefully vague boxes to only be reminiscent of the silhouette of computers so as not to represent any specific brands or type of OS. 

Two of the files open normally: one containing a simple grocery list, full of trivial and mundane things, another listing dates like birthdays or term dates. These files were to represent the everyday memories we keep accessible — casual, low-stakes information that hasn’t been emotionally encrypted at all. Their simplicity is intentional; they act as a baseline for what “normal” or unprotected memory looks like.


The final file, “when it changed,” behaves differently.

Clicking it scrambles its name and triggers a series of lightly mocking messages, as if the system itself remembers the missing password better than the user does. Each attempt generates a new scramble and a new reminder of the unfortunate fact of forgetting. 

After a short delay, the desktop offers two options: decrypt or delete. 

Choosing decrypt overwhelms the screen with error messages; fast, repetitive pop-ups that echo the panicked chaos of encountering malware, a blockage of sorts an imitation of the dread of resurfacing bad memories. (Which is implied by the file's title of 'when it changed').

Choosing delete causes the screen to fade gently to black, revealing a meditative message about memory, encryption, and the idea that some things become unreadable with time, and that not everything needs to be recovered.

The project ultimately becomes a metaphor for how we store, lose, and sometimes intentionally bury parts of our lives. Through these two outcomes, the project frames encryption not as a mathematical operation, but as a human process. Instead of focusing on technical encryption, this project uses human-centred interaction design to explore how people store, distort, and protect their emotional histories. The code itself is straightforward, but it works in service of a metaphor: the interface behaves like a mind with compartments, some open and ordinary, some locked, and some better left undisturbed.

In shaping the final screen, I wanted the project to resolve not with a technical conclusion, but with a reflective one. The concluding message is deliberately contemplative: a moment where the interface stops performing encryption and instead meditates on it.
