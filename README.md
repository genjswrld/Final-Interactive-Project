# Final-Interactive-Project


My final project is an interactive showcase exploring encryption (with an anecdotal twist).

I initially had quite a large idea wherein there would be a multi-room artwork with interactions that served as puzzles, forcing the user to participate in tasks that held resemblance to ‘decrypting’ codes to achieve the final password. This plan had involved three fully simulated encryption systems with much more complex animations and references to quantum computing; however, the outreach of this could soon become very vague and a large project to handle alone, and thus I chose to focus on an emotional narration that lends itself to encryption’s effects. But as I developed it, I realised something, the emotional experience of encryption, the way it hides things, the way it loses things , felt more important than the technical process itself.

So I scaled back to something quieter and more personal, that could still lend to encryption as metaphor.

I have always had a fascination with encrypting information, and would often quite rashly lock things away as a child, leading to large amounts of my old work being essentially lost as I could no longer recall the passwords I’d set for these files. Similarly, I was quite interested in ransomware and the encryption it imposed on victims’ files — another way in which the effects of encryption would evoke memory.

To simulate the emotions rather than the technicalities of encryption, I designed a simplistic and supposedly harmless display of a desktop with purposefully vague boxes to only be reminiscent of the silhouette of computers so as not to represent any specific brands or type of OS - it's vague in a sense of distant memory.

Two of the files open normally: one containing a simple grocery list, full of trivial and mundane things, another listing dates like birthdays or term dates

The final file, “when it changed,” behaves differently.

Clicking it scrambles its name and triggers a series of lightly mocking messages, as if the system itself remembers the missing password better than the user does. Each attempt generates a new scramble and a new reminder of the unfortunate fact of forgetting. 

After a short delay, the desktop offers two options: decrypt or delete.
